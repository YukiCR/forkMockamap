# forkMockamap
a copy of https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/mockamap   
from https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/ego-planner

I'm working on:
+ Ubuntu 20.04
+ ROS neotic

code from https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/mockamap doesn't work for me,
yet the mockamap in https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/ego-planner works on my machine, 
this is a just simple copy of the map part of that repo.
